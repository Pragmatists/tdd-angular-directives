### Step 1  
Test drive (write failing test first) the *Ciao* directive that will display
 'Hello world' in Italian.

### Step 2
Test-drive directive to display its text in blue color.
Use jasmine-jquery to assert on color of the text. [https://github.com/velesin/jasmine-jquery](https://github.com/velesin/jasmine-jquery)

### Step 3 
Refactor previous first test assertions to use jasmine-jquery.  

### Step 4  
Test drive that the *ciao* directive will not be shown at all, when name attribute
 is not provided (empty string, null or undefined) Use jasmine-jquery assertions.

### Step 5  
Write parametrized test for all cases from Step 4.

### Step 6
Test drive that the *ciao* directive will gain css class called *selected* when
 directive element gets clicked by mouse.    
`Heads up`: You can access directive element in link function. See [https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/service/$compile](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/service/$compile)
